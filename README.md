# Stanford-Machine-Learning
my code for the Stanford ML class

Some of the code isn't mine, such as the plotData and submit files. However, I included them because they're used for running the overall tests (ex1 and ex1_multi).

Included folders in ex1 and ex2 for code to run assignment, but not mine.

Didn't include those types of code files in ex3 and later
