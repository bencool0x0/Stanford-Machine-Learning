# Stanford-Machine-Learning
my code for the Stanford ML class

Some of the code isn't mine, such as the plotData and submit files. However, I included them because they're used for running the overall tests.

I will mention if I didn't write the code in the descriptions

This is my first time working with Octave and Machine Learning, how exciting!
